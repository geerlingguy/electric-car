# Electric Car

Information and learnings about EVs from Jeff Geerling.

This README contains the 'story' of my EV experience, but I will also be posting individual issues / struggles / learnings in the [Issues](https://github.com/geerlingguy/electric-car/issues).

## Equipment and Add-ons

Here are some of the things I've bought to make my EV experience a little better (some links are Amazon affiliate links. I earn for qualifying referrals):

  - [Grizzl-E Smart L2 40A NEMA 14-50 Charger](https://amzn.to/4k0tHwX) for the garage (in case I want to charge 3x faster than my normal 12A charger)
  - [Lectron L1 J1772 EV charger](https://amzn.to/3HIt2Tx) for a more portable charger, when I just need to top off the car for a few hours
  - [J1772 Wall mount for cable and plug](https://amzn.to/4l8f4ct) - I was going to 3D print one, but figured the metal product would hold up better in a garage in the midwest
  - [NACS to J1772](https://amzn.to/3T1PQjw) AC L1/L2 charging adapter
  - [CCS1 to CHAdeMO](https://a2zevshop.com/products/ccs1-to-chademo) L3 DC Fast charge adapter
  - [CarlinKit 5.0 Wireless CarPlay/Android Auto adapter](https://amzn.to/3SW9AVH) because the Leaf only supports wired CarPlay by default

## Nissan Leaf - bought used in 2023

I bought a used Nissan Leaf in 2023. Since test driving a Tesla in 2012, I hoped to buy an EV for my next car, after driving only regular gas cars my whole life.

I started with a used minivan, which I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Olds that I drove into the ground. Then I bought a Camry that I bought before we had kids, when I had a 16 mile commute.

Fast forward about 15 years, and I found myself with a very short commute, only driving a few miles a day, and a family minivan we use for nearly all the 'driving around the kids' stuff.

So I wanted a smaller car (get back a foot or so of garage space...) that was also more efficient.

### Why buy electric?

I overanalyze most things, so had been researching this purchase for about a decade now.

With EVs there are tradeoffs. Even in my situation, only driving a car a few miles a day, I _do_ take my car on one or two regional road trips every year.

Having the ability to hop in at 6 am and be in Chicago or KC by late morning is nice. Having to plan a long break somewhere halfway to charge is not.

But if I only take that trip once a year, I can either (a) rent a gas car that gets me there a little more quickly, and ensures I don't have to find a spot in the destination city to do a full charge before the return trip. Or (b) plan for an extra X hours total during the trip to ensure I have padding for charging.

Charging infrastructure's improving in the US (and in many parts of the world), but it's nowhere near as ubiquitous as gas stations.

Hopefully this improves over time, but for now, I plan on using the electric car for local travel, likely only going more than 100 miles or so in a day once or twice a year.

### Why buy Leaf?

Price.

That's mostly it. And I had driving a Nissan Altima rental car recently, and realized Nissan isn't half bad. They seem to not require an Internet connection for their cars, they offer basic lane following and adaptive cruise control, they have CarPlay/Android Auto...

The Leaf ticks all the little 'convenience' checkboxes, but is also not 'extravagant'.

And the later model years also aren't "look at me I drive an EV" ugly (though they're not amazing-looking either, IMO.)

But I drove a minivan, an olds, and a Camry, so obviously I'm function > form when it comes to my car!

Because of the smaller battery (and up until 2026, a battery with no active cooling), combined with the use of a DC fast charging connector (CHAdeMO) that's going out of style in the US, used Nissan Leafs are priced _considerably_ lower than competitors.

Well, all except maybe Teslas around a year or two older right now. But Teslas don't have native CarPlay. And I'm not a fan of how Tesla is trying to turn the car into some kind of appliance, RoboTaxi, self-driving thing, versus it being a transportation vehicle that I can do what I want with.

No judgement on Tesla owners, the used Tesla market was enticing at the time I bought the Leaf.

I also looked a lot at the Hyundai Ioniq and Kona; both were just a _little_ bit too large for my liking, but they could've worked. The problem was used models in good condition were a lot more expensive than I was willing to pay.

So back to the Leaf: Nissan's probably not the _best_ right now when it comes to EVs and features, but they're certainly the _cheapest_. And 'good enough' is fine by me.

_She's got it where it counts, kid._

## The joy of electric

I don't care about engine noise. I appreciate it, though. My brother had a 1992 Forumula Firebird. And I nearly owned it after he moved away, instead of the old minivan! (But I'm a boring-car person, so I think I was happier with the minivan).

The nice things about electric vehicles that swayed me in their favor, in descending order:

  - **One pedal driving** Seriously, why doesn't every EV have this mode? It makes driving one feel SO much better than any gas car, in terms of connection between driver and car movement.
  - **Sprightly torque**: Outside of exotic tiny gas cars, you're not going to get the same zip even a cheap EV like a Leaf gives you—smash the accelerator in non-Eco mode and any passenger will giggle, every time.
  - **Blissful quiet**: Though some cars have annoying noises they play at low speeds.
  - **Lower maintenance requirements**: I hate every time I have to jack up my car and change the brakes, or take it in for oil/fluid changes. EVs require a lot less maintenance, besides maybe tires)
  - **Conveniences**: Like running climate control to cool down/heat up the car prior to hopping in, even if it's in an enclosed space like a garage! Or plugging it in to charge at home, and not having to stop by a gas station.
  - **Long-term economics**: in _general_, charging with electricity, at least here in St. Louis, is cheaper than filling up with gas, on a dollar-per-mile basis.

## The pain of electric

All that said, I knew going into this there would be some pain. Maybe in 10 or 20 years these things will get solved, but off the top of my head:

  - **Price**: The Leaf (especially used, right now) is the cheapest, but it is by no means _cheap_. It takes a few years to break even with a similarly-specced gas car. But buying a gas car, you have a lot more options on the low-low end.
  - **Range Anxiety**: Yes, it's overblown, but no, it's not non-existent. The day I _bought_ my used EV, the dealership (which doesn't sell many EVs, even new) didn't have a 'Level 3' DC fast charger—and they had only charged it to about 16%. Letting it top off at L2 while I was dealing with finance, we got to 23%. I wasn't quite sure I'd make it home off the lot! Luckily I did, with 12 miles of range remaining. Road tripping or day trips require more planning when driving an EV.
  - **Lack of standards**: The Leaf has a CHAdeMO port. Teslas and many newer EVs have NACS. Then there's CCS1 and CCS2. And charging stations are run by multiple vendors with multiple apps and payment methods. It's not like gas stations, like with Shell, BP, Buckee's, etc. where you just drive up, stick the gas nozzle in your tank, and squeeze. Even adapters can be complicated and annoying, and many EV charging stations only support one or two standards—and some may only have _one_ CHAdeMO plug, and that plug may have been ripped off the unit to be scrapped by a copper thief!
  - **Being an EV**: For some reason, most EVs look like... EVs. I honestly was holding out hope Tesla would just make a Corolla, but an EV version. All the cheap EVs like the Bolt, i3, Leaf, etc. just look... sorta ugly. Subjective, sure, but at least my Olds looked kinda sleek. Even if it was an Olds. EVs stand out, and that I don't enjoy. I want an EV that looks like a Camry. Just blend in and don't stand out.
  - **Cables and chargers**: The Leaf has slightly less trunk space than my slightly-larger Camry. I didn't realize how big L1/L2 charge cables are. Even L1-only cables (which charge at a very anemic pace, like 10 miles / hour of charge) are fairly thick, bulky affairs. About 1/10 of my truck is devoted to my charging cable. And on a road trip, I will likely carry my [NACS to J1772](https://amzn.to/3T1PQjw) and [CCS1 to CHAdeMO](https://a2zevshop.com/products/ccs1-to-chademo) adapters. And the latter adapter includes its _own_ battery and firmware that has to be charged and managed!

Be sure to check the Issues in this repository for more of my EV adventures.

I don't plan on becoming an EV advocate by any means; I don't think they're a good choice for many (if not most) people yet, especially considering the price disparity and infrastructure requirements that exclude large swaths of the population entirely!
